# Mastermind

Welcome to Mastermind! This is a simple C# console app by Zane Eisen.
Make sure you have dotnet installed (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download). If you run into problems, you might need to install the latest version.

The src folder holds my source code for the Mastermind game.
To play Mastermind, clone or download the repository. Open a terminal, navigate to the src directory, and run:

dotnet run Mastermind.csproj

The Mastermind-Tests folder holds Unit Tests I wrote to help make sure my Functions work properly.
To run the tests I wrote, clone or download the repository. Open a terminal, navigate to the Mastermind directory, and run:

dotnet test Mastermind-Tests/Mastermind-Tests.csproj

Enjoy!
